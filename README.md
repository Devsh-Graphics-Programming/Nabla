**Nabla** (previously called **[IrrlichtBaW](https://github.com/buildaworldnet/IrrlichtBAW)** ) is a new renovated version of older **[Irrlicht](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/)** engine. 
The name change to Nabla allows for using Nabla side by side with the legacy Irrlicht and IrrlichtBaW engines. 
The project currently aims for a thread-able and *Vulkan*-centered API, but currently works on *OpenGL* only.

## Required Build Tools and SDK's

### Vanilla Build - most extensions disabled

- **[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)** 
- **[MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pl/downloads/)** or **[GCC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)**
- **[Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)**, at least **1.2.198.1** version ***without* any components** installed
- **[Perl 5.28 executable version](https://www.perl.org/get.html)**
- **[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/?C=M;O=D)**
- **[Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)** or later

### Vanilla + CUDA Build

**Nabla** only supports *CUDA* interop using the Driver API not the Runtime API. We use the runtime compiled CUDA.

Because *CUDA* needs its own version the GeForce (Quadro or Tesla) Driver, its often a few minor versions behind your automatically updated Windows driver, the install will fail even if it prompts you to agree to installing an older driver. 

So basically first remove your driver, then install *CUDA SDK*.

- **[CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)**

#### CMake warnings in reference CUDA and notes

On Windows *CMake* has trouble finding new packages installed after *CMake*, so its the perfect time to visit **[it's website](https://cmake.org/)** and check for a new version installer after installing *CUDA SDK*.

You can also thank NVidia for making the CUDA SDK a whole whopping 2.5 GB on Windows.

### Vanilla + CUDA + Optix Build

After dealing with *CUDA* installing just install *Optix SKD*.

- **[OptiX SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/download)** 

### Android Build

**Required:**

- **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)**
- **[JDK 8](https://www.java.com/download/)**

The first step is to install Android Studio and JDK 8. When done, open Android Studio and navigate to **Tools** -> **SDK Manager** -> **System Settings** -> **Android SDK**.
Select *SDK Platforms* and install proper individual SDK components - install Android version with Android API level you will be targeting. Then switch to *SDK Tools* and make sure to install **Android SDK Build-Tools 32** and **NDK (Side by side)** - it's a *requirement*! Also you must make sure that your **JAVA_HOME** enviroment variable is set to proper JDK installation path.

Now you can begin CMake'ing. We use **Ninja** generator tools as a generator for building Nabla for Android on both Windows and Linux Host-OSes. *Note that Nabla Android build has been performed and tested so far on Windows as cross compile OS with **Ninja** generator and on Linux as cross compile OS with **Makefile** and **Ninja** generators, but we recommend using **Ninja** for both OSes.* 

Before configuring CMake you must add 2 cache variables:

- **ANDROID_PLATFORM**
- **ANDROID_ABI**

**ANDROID_PLATFORM** is a target API platform that you pass as `android-x` where `x` is your android API level (you can pass 28 for instance). **ANDROID_ABI** is Application Binary Interface and note, that we support only `x86_64` currently. Those 2 cache variables *must be* specified before CMake configuration. Having done it you can specify toolchain file for cross-compiling by passing path to `android.toolchain.cmake`. You can find it in Android Studio's SDK directory in `ndk/<version>/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake`. Basically the entire path should look like this one `C:/Users/<your_user>/AppData/Local/AndroidSdk/ndk/<version>/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake`. With all of this feel free to generate.

Having Nabla generated you need to enter build directory, launch the terminal and type `cmake --build . --target Nabla -j4 -v` or if you want build android sample example you would type `cmake --build . --target android_sample_apk -j4 -v`. The android sample example produces *.apk* file you can use for debugging and profiling.

**Note:** each example provided by the engine builds as an executable with non-cross builds and with target of a name called `a_target`, in following example above it would be `android_sample`. When building cross-compile for android **to produce the APK file you need to add `_apk` postfix to the `a_target`, because `a_target` gets built then as a library.

#### Chrome Book SDK version

In order for the chromebook to work with the apk you build you need to install the right SDK version. Go to **Tools** -> **SDK Manager** -> **System Settings** -> **Android SDK** then select the *SDK Platforms* tab and tick the "Show Packake Details" checkbox in the bottom-right corner. After that select *Android 9.0 (Pie) -> Android SDK Platform 28* and hit "OK".

#### Chrome Book upload

To upload generated *.apk* into your ChromeBook you need first to make sure your device is in *developer mode* state. If it is, you can open Android Studio and choose Debug or Profile choosing *.apk* file. Then you will need to connect to your device using **adb** connector. To make use of adb, you need to find path to the executable that is placed in `C:/Users/<your_user>/AppData/Local/AndroidSdk/platform-tools` directory. When found, you can type in Android Studio command line `C:/Users/<your_user>/AppData/Local/AndroidSdk/platform-tools/adb connect <IP of ChromeBook network>`. You can find ChromeBook's IP by entering network settings and choosing current network ChromeBook is connected to. This way the ChromeBook should be listed in available devices and you should be able to upload *.apk* to the machine through debugging app shortcut. Take into account that you won't probably be able to debug in that scenario, but you will be able to upload *.apk* to the device.

#### Chrome Book debug

To debug the *.apk* on your chromebook you need to open the source file you want to debug in Android Studio (Either via *File->Open* or Drag&Drop, but be aware that d&d can deadlock your Android Studio 25% of the time so youll need to restart it), then place your breakpoints and hit "Debug" (The bug icon)  in the top right corner.

## External Dependencies

- **gl.h** header for *OpenGL* (possible to obtain even on headless servers from *mesa-libgl-devel*)
- **OpenCL SDK** (can get rid of it by compiling without the two *OpenCL* files)

## Future Boost Library Dependencies

**Nabla** uses or will use the following **[*Boost*](https://www.boost.org/)** libraries:

- [ ] **[Bimap](http://man.hubwiz.com/docset/Boost.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/boost/libs/bimap/doc/html/boost_bimap/bimap_and_boost.html)**
- [ ] **[Context](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/context/doc/html/context/overview.html)** (maybe, and if yes only the *fcontext_t* variant)
- [ ] **[Interprocess](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/doc/html/interprocess.html)**
- [ ] **[Special](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/math/doc/html/special.html)**
- [ ] **[Stacktrace](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/doc/html/stacktrace.html)** (we already have stack tracing on Linux, might be less work to do it on Windows)

The maybe's depend on how *xplatform* and easy to operate the *boost::context* is, esp w.r.t. Linux, Windows and Android. We will not use *boost::fibers* as we need our own complex scheduler.

## Building Nabla library

### Cloning the project

Begin with cloning **Nabla** with:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/Devsh-Graphics-Programming/Nabla.git
```

If you haven't cloned `recursive`ly, you have to also perform:

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

*CMake* config script will try to initialize submodules for you however as well, but it doesn't mean the initialization attempt will be successful.

### Submodules

If you haven't initialized the submodules yourself before the *CMake* configure step, and out *CMake* submodule update script destroyed them (badly/half initialized), you can run the following set of commands, but **beware** - it will completely wipe any changes to submodules.

```shell
git submodule foreach --recursive git clean -xfd
git submodule foreach --recursive git reset --hard
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Weird CMake behaviour, notes

Sometimes it may appear that there **won't be any files in submodules directories**. If so, you have to bring them back by using:

```shell
git reset --hard
```

on each submodule's directory required! Furthermore you have to:

```shell
git checkout tags/glew-cmake-2.1.0
```

in *glew* directory that you can find in ***3rdparty/CEGUI/glew*** directory because of *glew* commiting politics. Having done it you can switch to your ***master/root*** directory and commit those changes if you want, but it isn't necessary to compile entire library.

### CMake notes

#### Make sure Python's executable is found

- The paragraph concerns *Windows system* only

Unfortunately on Windows there are often troubles with **Python 3.0+** versions, because it isn't able to find and determine `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` variable, so you have to fill it manually. If you use **CMake-GUI** you will find it in advanced options.

#### Consider CMake and Visual Studio version, **important**! 

- The paragraph concerns *Visual Studio* only

Make sure you have installed the latest version of *Visual Studio* and *CMake*. Within older versions sometimes there may occur that *Visual Studio* outputs an error associated with compiler heap space. If you don't get any error, just skip the point. It's because having *x64* project opened the solution still uses *32 bit compiler exe* and cannot allocate **more than 4G of memory**, therefore **Nabla** is unbuildable. Furthermore *Visual Studio* doesn't provide any option to change that. Because of that you have to manually modify **.vcxproj xml** and add `x64` to `PropertyGroup` nodes. Pay attention that *CMake* generates a standard `PropertyGroup` node, but it isn't enough, because you need to put it into the target where building type is directly specified. It should look for instance as following:

```xml
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|x64'" Label="Configuration">
    <PreferredToolArchitecture>x64</PreferredToolArchitecture>
    <ConfigurationType>StaticLibrary</ConfigurationType>
    <CharacterSet>MultiByte</CharacterSet>
    <PlatformToolset>v142</PlatformToolset>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Current example above shows *Release* mode, but you should consider *Debug* as well. Having it done, 64bit cl.exe binary usage will be assured. When u get this problem, don't bother with editing all the **.vcxproj**s. It will probably only matter while building the engine, so the only thing you have to do is edit that **.vcxproj** you actually use - **Nabla.vcxproj** for instance and that's it. 

If you know a way to make *CMake* generating **.vcxproj**s already having those changes that will solve the issue, it will be great if you let us know about it :)

#### CMake on 64bit Windows

- Best to use *cmake-gui*

Run *cmake-gui* and, as usually, give *CMake* root **Nabla** directory and where you want *CMake* to put project files and click "Configure" field. When *CMake* asks you to choose compiler/IDE, make sure to check whether there's a distinct option for *64bit* mode and, if this is the case, choose this one.

For single-config IDEs (Code::Blocks) you'll have to manually set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Debug` or `Release`. `Release` is default.

You also have options `BUILD_EXAMPLES` and `BUILD_TOOLS` which do exactly what they say. By "*tools*" you should currently understand just `convert2baw`.

For Windows *MSVC* required, *MinGW* build system maintenance will be delegated to the community.

#### CMake on 64bit Linux

Same as Windows, except that currently we have no way of setting the correct working directory for executing the examples from within the IDE (for debugging). If you care about this please submit an *issue/PR/MR* to **[*CMake's* gitlab](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake)**.

We recommend the ***[Codelite IDE](https://codelite.org/)*** as that has a *CMake-gui* generator and has been tested and works relatively nice.

**[*Visual Studio Code*](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** suffers from a number of issues such as configuring the *CMake* every time you want to build a target and slow build times. Here are the issues:

1. **https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/771**
2. **https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/772**
3. **https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/773**

***[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) toolset*** is unmaintained and untested on Linux.

## First examples launching, significant notes

Remember you have to set up **starting target project** in *Visual Studio* before you begin to launch your example. To do that click on **Solution Explorer**, find the example name, hover on it and click on **Set as StartUp Project**. You can disable building examples by `NBL_BUILD_EXAMPLES` option in *CMake*.

## Use Nabla in your project!

To get **Nabla** to be used by an external application *without adding it as a subdirectory*,but still using a submodule, you should perform following:

```cmake
set(NBL_SOURCE_DIR "<YOUR_NABLA_SOURCE_DIRECTORY>") # PAY ATTENTION: you have to fill this one with Nabla source directory
set(NBL_BINARY_DIR "${NBL_SOURCE_DIR}/build")
set(NBL_INSTALL_DIR "${NBL_BINARY_DIR}/install")

list(APPEND NBL_CMAKE_ARGS "-DNBL_BUILD_DOCS:BOOL=OFF") # enable only if you have doxygen installed and detectable by cmake
list(APPEND NBL_CMAKE_ARGS "-DNBL_BUILD_EXAMPLES:BOOL=OFF")
list(APPEND NBL_CMAKE_ARGS "-DNBL_BUILD_TOOLS:BOOL=OFF") # the tools don't work yet (Apr 2020 status, might have changed since then)
list(APPEND NBL_CMAKE_ARGS "-DNBL_BUILD_MITSUBA_LOADER:BOOL=OFF") # you probably don't want this extension
list(APPEND NBL_CMAKE_ARGS "-D_NBL_COMPILE_WITH_BAW_LOADER_:BOOL=OFF") # you probably don't want this extension
list(APPEND NBL_CMAKE_ARGS "-D_NBL_COMPILE_WITH_BAW_WRITER_:BOOL=OFF") # you probably don't want this extension
list(APPEND NBL_CMAKE_ARGS "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${NBL_INSTALL_DIR}") # because of https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/18790

ExternalProject_Add(Nabla
    DOWNLOAD_COMMAND  ""
    SOURCE_DIR        "${NBL_SOURCE_DIR}"
    BINARY_DIR        "${NBL_BINARY_DIR}"
    CMAKE_ARGS        ${NBL_CMAKE_ARGS}
    TEST_COMMAND      ""
)

include(${NBL_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/build/AddNablaModule.cmake)

# now if you create executable you can use addNablaModule
add_executable(executableTest main.cpp) # assuming main.cpp exsists

# add Nabla module to "executableTest"
addNablaModule(executableTest "${NBL_INSTALL_DIR}")
```

 If you want to use git (without a submodule) then you can use `ExternalProject_Add` with the `GIT_` properties instead.

I recommend you use `ExternalProject_Add` instead of `add_subdirectory` for **Nabla** as we haven't  tested its use by *3rdparty* applications that use *CMake* to build themselves yet (**BaW EDU** uses it directly from *MSVC*/*make* like it's still the stone-age of build systems).
