		have to draw Irrlicht on your own. You can use this loop, as
		usual:
		\code
		while (device->run())
		{

		Instead of this, you can also simply use your own message loop
		using GetMessage, DispatchMessage and whatever. Calling
		IrrlichtDevice::run() will cause Irrlicht to dispatch messages
		internally too.  You need not call Device->run() if you want to
		do your own message dispatching loop, but Irrlicht will not be
		able to fetch user input then and you have to do it on your own
		using the window messages, DirectInput, or whatever. Also,
		you'll have to increment the Irrlicht timer.
		An alternative, own message dispatching loop without
		device->run() would look like this:
		\code
		MSG msg;
		while (true)
		{
			if (PeekMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE))
			{
				TranslateMessage(&msg);
				DispatchMessage(&msg);

				if (msg.message == WM_QUIT)
					break;
			}

			// increase virtual timer time
			device->getTimer()->tick();

			// draw engine picture
			driver->beginScene(true, true, 0);
			smgr->drawAll();
			driver->endScene();
		}
		\endcode
		However, there is no need to draw the picture this often. Just
		do it how you like. */
