//! Writing flags
/**
	They have an impact on writing (saving) an Asset.
	Take into account that a writer may not support all of those flags.
	For instance, if there is a PNG or JPG writer, it won't write encrypted images.

	@see IAssetWriter::getSupportedFlags()
	@see IAssetWriter::getForcedFlags()

	E_WRITER_FLAGS::EWF_NONE means that there aren't writer flags (default).
	E_WRITER_FLAGS::EWF_COMPRESSED means that it has to write in a way that consumes less disk space if possible.
	E_WRITER_FLAGS::EWF_ENCRYPTED means that it has to write in encrypted way if possible.
	E_WRITER_FLAGS::EWF_BINARY means that it has to write in binary format rather than text if possible.

//! A class that defines rules during Asset-writing (saving) process
/**
	Some assets can be saved to file (or memory file) by classes derived from IAssetWriter.
	These classes must be registered with IAssetManager::addAssetWriter() which will add it
	to the list of writers (grab return 0-based index) or just not register the writer upon 
	failure (donï¿½t grab and return 0xdeadbeefu).

	The writing is impacted by writing flags, defined as E_WRITER_FLAGS.

	Remember that loaded Asset doesn't actually know how it was created in reference to certain file extension it was called from,
	so if you loaded an Asset from .baw, you can save it to another file with different extension if a valid writer is provided.

	When the class derived from IAssetWriter is added, its put once on a 
	std::multimap<std::pair<IAsset::E_TYPE,std::string>,IAssetWriter*> for every 
	asset type and file extension it supports, and once on a std::multimap<IAsset::E_TYPE,IAssetWriter*> 
	for every asset type it supports.

	The writers are tried in the order they were registered per-asset-type-and-file-extension, 
	or in the per-asset-type order in the case of writing straight to file without a name.

	An IAssetWriter can only be removed/deregistered by its original pointer or global loader index.
