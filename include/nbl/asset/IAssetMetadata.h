	Sometimes there may be nedeed attaching some metadata by a Loader
	into Asset structure - that's why the class is defined.

	Pay attention that it hasn't been done exactly yet, engine doesn't provide
	metadata injecting.

	Metadata are extra data retrieved by the loader, which aren't ubiquitously representable by the engine.
	These could be for instance global data about the file or scene, IDs, names, default view/projection,
	complex animations and hierarchies, physics simulation data, AI data, lighting or extra material metadata.

	Flexibility has been provided, it is expected each loader has its own base metadata class implementing the 
	IAssetMetadata interface with its own type enum that other loader's metadata classes derive from the base.
