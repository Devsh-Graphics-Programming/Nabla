//! An abstract data type class representing an interface of any kind of cpu-objects with capability of being cached
/**
	An Asset is a CPU object which needs to be loaded for caching it to RAM memory,
	or needs to be filled with Asset-data if it has to be created by hand,
	and then may be converted to GPU object, but it isn't necessary in each case! For instance
	ICPUBuffer which is an Asset opens a nice way to represent a plain byte array, but doesn't need
	to be converted into GPU object!

	@see ICPUBuffer

	Actually an Asset is a class deriving from it that can be anything like cpu-side meshes scenes, texture data and material pipelines, 
	but must be serializable into/from .baw file format, unless it comes from an extension (nbl::ext), 
	so forth cached. There are different asset types you can find at IAsset::E_TYPE. 
	IAsset doesn't provide direct instantiation (virtual destructor), much like IReferenceCounted.

	Asset type's naming-convention is ICPU_x, where _x is a name of an Asset, eg. ICPUBuffer, ICPUMesh e.t.c

	Every asset must be loaded by a particular class derived from IAssetLoader.
