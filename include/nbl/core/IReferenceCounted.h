Engine are derived from IReferenceCounted, and so they are reference counted.

When you create an object in the Irrlicht engine, calling a method
which starts with 'create', an object is created, and you get a pointer
to the new object. If you no longer need the object, you have
to call drop(). This will destroy the object, if grab() was not called
in another part of you program, because this part still needs the object.
Note, that you only need to call drop() to the object, if you created it,
and the method had a 'create' in it.
